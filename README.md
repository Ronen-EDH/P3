# Restaurant Listing Website for Ohmyfood

This is an OpenClassrooms student repo for project 3 by EDH.

## Project Description

### Scenario

Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business. The objective was to develop a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants.
My task for this project was to create a static website following a design mockup and there were also five design effects to be achieved.

### Main requirements

- The whole site will have to be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- The pages will have to pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS without errors
- The site must be fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- The development will have to be in CSS, without JavaScript
- No framework should be used; however, Sass would be a plus
- No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag
- Track the code project with version control on GitHub

### The design effect for this project

- Home page loading spinner
- Buttons changing slightly on hover
- Heart-shaped Like button should fill up on hover(On the restaurant cards)
- When arriving on a menu page, the dishes should appear gradually
- A small checkmark should appear to the right of the dish on hover(mimicking the example animation)

## Technologies Used

HTML to create the structure and navigation for the website, SASS for design consistency and design effects,  
BEM methodology for cleaner source code, CSS grid for layout.
